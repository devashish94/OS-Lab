# Operating Systems Lab

**Lab: 1** Basic Linux Terminal Commands
- Introduction to Linux Terminal Commands

**Lab: 2** Introduction to Bash Scripting
- Introduction to Bash Scripting

**Lab: 3** Bash Conditionals
- Conditionals in Bash Scripting

**Lab: 4** More Bash Conditionals AND Bash Utilities
- logical AND operator '&'
- logical OR operator '||'
- addition operation
- subtraction operation
- expr command
- 'bc' utility to get floating point values
- getting square root of a number using 'bc
- printing values of array

**Lab: 5** Loops in Bash
- For loop
- While loop
- Nested for loop OR while loop (anyone of them)

**Lab: 6** System Calls
- write a program to implement system call
- write a program to read data from the standard input device and write it on the screen
- write a program using open system call to read first 10 character of existing file and print them on the screen
- write a program to dup system call both Auto and User-Defined 

**Lab: 7** Fork
- simple fork 
- assign different jobs to child and parent processes 
- orphan process 
- zombie process 

**Lab: 8** First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm
- Print the Average Turn Around Time and Average Waiting Time
- Given:
    - Arrays for PID, Arrival Time and Burst Time
- Create 2 arrays for Waiting Time and Turn Around Time
- 2 variables for Total Waiting Time, Total Turn Around Time. Set them to 0.
- T.C. and S.C. is important in such types of algorithms
- Use forumulae learnt in class to reduce the T.C. of the program

**Lab: 9** Shortest Job First Algorithm (Non-Preemptive)
- Print the Average Turn Around Time and Average Waiting Time
- <b>Given</b>: Arrays for PID, Arrival Time and Burst Time

**Lab: 10** Remaining CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- Shortest Job First Algorithm
- Priority Scheduling (Pre-emptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Non Pre-emptive)
- Round Robin
